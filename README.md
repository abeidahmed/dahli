# Welcome to Dahli

A collection of everyday Web Components.

> All the components follow [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/). If
anything doesn't align with these guidelines, please open an [issue](https://github.com/abeidahmed/dahli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAPG).

## Motivation for creating the components

Whenever I start a new project, I realized that I keep copying the same set of components from my previous project.
It wasted a lot of time setting up the boilerplate code when that time could've been used in developing the app.
To make it worse, the components didn't need to change the functionality from one application to another because
they were so basic and fundamental in building a website or an application.

With the help of these [packages](https://github.com/abeidahmed/dahli/tree/main/packages), I intend to save some of my
personal time and help the community as well, who are treading the same path as I did before. Enjoy!
